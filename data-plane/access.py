"""Agent catalog and access resolution.

Access is derived entirely from Databricks-native state - there is no local
permissions database to drift out of sync:

    what an agent is   -> a serving endpoint whose task is agent/v1/responses
    its friendly name  -> endpoint tags (display_name, blurb)
    who may use it     -> the endpoint's own ACL (CAN_QUERY / CAN_MANAGE)
    an "agent set"     -> a workspace group named in those ACLs

Listing needs the app identity because reading an ACL requires CAN_MANAGE,
which end users do not have. That is safe: listing only decides what is *shown*.
Invocation always uses the user's own token, so Databricks remains the authority
on what can actually be run.
